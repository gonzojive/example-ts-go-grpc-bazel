<h1>Angular, gRPC-web, Bazel, and Go</h1>

This is an example of building an Angular app with a gRPC-web server.
Using gRPC-web to communicate between the web client and server allows
use of protocol buffers to specify the (private) API between client and
server, allowing fairly rapid and typesafe evolution of the app.

This example is based on the
<a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-bazel-example">Angular + bazel example app</a>
and still has some pieces that should be removed.

This application mimics a developer console for a cloud provider.
There are ten sections in the left nav, which represent ten different teams that contribute their functionality to the single-page application.
This is similar to how Google Cloud Console is developed with Bazel.
